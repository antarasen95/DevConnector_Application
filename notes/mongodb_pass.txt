3 resources:
users
profiles
posts


routes->api->files
they are going to fetch json from backend and serve it to the front end
so they it could be rendered or viewed

Each resource we have :
users
profiles
posts

need to have a mongoose model schema so that it could be used to store data


queries:
 bcrypt.genSalt(10, (err, salt) =>{
                bcrypt.hash(newUser.password, salt)
            })
        }



HOW TO HIT THE REQUIRED API FROM FRONTEND??
FOR THAT WE WILL BE USING AXIOS
axios.get(/the api to be hit)
for example

axios.get(http://localhost/api/users/resgister)

we just want to do
axios.get(/api/user)



WE WOULD BE USING REACT ROUTER AS WELL BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PAGES
AND WE NEED TO LINK THEM
